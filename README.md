# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction
The objective of this assignment is to train machine learning models that can accurately predict
the cardiovascular risk (low, medium, high) of an individual, using the information provided in
the “dataset.csv” dataset. The results can be helpful for cardiovascular disease diagnosis and
prevention.
